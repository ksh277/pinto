   - Right side: Image of money/cash and coins (use illustration if possible).

3. **Reward Coupon Section (3 Boxes in a Row)**:
   - Title: "Sign up now and get 3 reward coupons instantly!"
   - Each box should show:
     - Coupon title
     - Amount (bold and large font)
     - Short description and validity
   - Layout (three columns):
     - Box 1: "Membership Join Reward - 2,000 KRW"
     - Box 2: "First Purchase Thanks - 1,000 KRW"
     - Box 3: "Birthday Celebration - 1,000 KRW"
   - Include note below: “*Coupons are automatically issued. Validity may vary (e.g., 30~60 days)."

4. **Tier Benefits Table (Grid layout)**:
   - Title: "Compare Membership Benefits by Tier"
   - Column headers: BASIC, SPECIAL, VIP, VVIP (with icons for each tier)
   - Row items:
     - Tier Requirement (e.g. "Under 3 million KRW per year", "Over 10 million KRW", etc.)
     - Points (1% of purchase for all tiers)
     - Shipping (e.g. "Free shipping over 50,000 KRW", "Free shipping on all orders")
     - Benefits (additional discount %, brochure/sample for VIP/VVIP)

5. **Styling Tips**:
   - Use soft, friendly colors (blue, gray, white)
   - Make it mobile-responsive
   - Use icons or badges for each membership tier
   - Emphasize benefit percentages (like "+2%", "+4%") using color or bold

6. **Additional Notes**:
   - Add a note below the table: “*Tiers are based on actual payment amounts from Jan 9 to Dec 31 annually.”

Generate this section as part of the homepage or as a standalone "Benefits" page.
